## Question 1 Numpy. 
1. Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3x3 ndarray filled with values between 1 and 27. 
2. Write a NumPy program to compute sum of all elements, sum of each column and sum of each row of a given array 
3. Write a NumPy program to create a 2-D array whose diagonal equals [4, 5, 6, 8] and 0's elsewhere.
4. Write a NumPy program that creates below array with 1 on the border and 0 inside. Example:\
[[1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]\
[1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]\
[1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]\
[1. 0. 0. 0. 1.]\
[1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]]

â€¢	Write a program that creates array1 and then write a program that extracts (slice) array2 from array1. 

array1
array([[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
       [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10],
       [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
       [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
       [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]])	

array2
array([[12, 13, 14, 15],
       [17, 18, 19, 20],
       [22, 23, 24, 25]])







## Question 2. Pandas.

Attached is a CSV that contains Covid19 statistics for 04/26/2020. This data is from data repository for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
Perform the following tasks for this dataset: 
1.	Write a program to get the latest number of confirmed, deaths, recovered and active cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Country wise.
2.	Write a program to get the USA state wise cases of confirmed, deaths and recovered cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
3.	Write a program to list countries with no cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) recovered.
4.	Write a program to list countries with all cases of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) recovered.
5.	Write a program to get the top 10 countries data (Last Update, Country/Region, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered) of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
